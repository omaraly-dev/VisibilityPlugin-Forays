# VisibilityPlugin
This plugin controls the visibility of players, pets and chocobos. It has been modified from the master branch to function in Exploration Forays for weaker hardware. Be aware that safeties and built-in configuration of this safety bypass have not been implemented yet.

## About
Visibility lets you hide those pesky players and their chocobos in hunts and major towns to reduce framerate drops and just give better quality of life.
It also comes with VoidList, which is a better blacklist.

It provides:
* Ability to hide players, pets and chocobos.
* Ability to filter hidden players by party, friends, free company, and dead.
* Ability to filter chocobos and pets by party, friends and free company.

### VoidList
